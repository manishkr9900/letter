            <P style="line-height: 2;">Dear Eileena,</P>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's 
                science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your 
                questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        
            <h3>Starting dates</h3>

            <h3>Subject of study</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded 
                research facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere
                in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, 
                dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have 
                on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
                 intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
                <ol style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health 
                    benifits of Resveratol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C(86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3&times;10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                    <li><span style="text-decoration: dotted underline;">HTML</span > and <span style="text-decoration: dotted underline;">CSS</span> constructs 
                    for representing musical scores.</li>
                </ol>
                <p style="line-height: 1.5;">So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd except
                    the research to tale, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.
                </p>
                <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Yes, you are right! As part of my post-dectorate work, I <i>did</i> study 
                    exotic tribal dance. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
                
                <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Polynesian Chicken dance<br/> 
                    <span style="display:block; padding-left: 40px; padding-bottom: 0px;"> A little but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, 
                    a whole village would dance dance, around in circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</span>

                    Icelandic brownian shuffle<br/>
                    <span style="display:block; padding-left: 40px;">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, 
                    which involed huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies 
                    around in imprerceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say 
                    that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</span>
                    
                    Arctic robot dance<br/>
                    <span style="display:block; padding-left: 40px;">An Interesting example of historic misinformation,
                       English explorers in the 1960s belived to have 
                      discovered a new dnace style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, 
                      being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however 
                      it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</span>
